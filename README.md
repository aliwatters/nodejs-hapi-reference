# Nodejs HAPI Reference - version 14.2.0

A skeleton repo for quick cloning and modifying.

NOTE: requires git > 1.8

Currently includes:

* gitignore - don't check in logs, node_modules, tempfiles and the like.
* editorconfig - www.editorconfig.org - use the editor of your choice and remain consistent.
* eslint - lint javascript files
* jsbeautify - fix formatting automatically

```
npm run lint
npm run beautify
```
# HAPI JS

My preferred server framework for node web/rest applications.

Includes:

* plugin loader - plugins/load.js
* lightweight request logging - lib/logging.js
* example and slightly useless plugins, "hello, goodbye, status"
